# Footprint Wizards

This repository contains footprint wizards for use with KiCad EDA software (www.kicad.org). 

Footprint wizards allow parameteric generation of various PCB footprints using user-specified values.

Wizards are written in the Python programming language (www.python.org) and a range of helper functions are provided to simplify wizard development.

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/KiCad/Footprint_Wizards/wiki) for detailed information on creating custom Wizard scripts.
